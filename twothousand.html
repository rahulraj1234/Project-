			 <b>One of the most serious US environmental disasters east of the Mississippi River occurs Oct. 11, 2000,  in the far eastern Appalachian region of Kentucky.</b>  
			Over 300 million gallons of thick, black coal slurry sludge explodes out of a mountainside when a Massey Energy Co.  
			dam collapses near Inez (Martin County), Kentucky into the Big Sandy River’s Tug Fork and its tributaries. 
			The spill destroyed 100 miles of streams and killed millions of fish. (See Kentuckians for the Commonwealth site for photos).
			The spill is significant not only for its scale but also for what was revealed about corruption in the US environmental system.  
			When National Mine Health and Safety Academy engineer Jack Sparado was called in to investigate the spill, he found that Massey Energy officials knew about a 1994 spill from the same dam which they had misrepresented.  
			But Spadaro’s investigation was cut off and, when Sparado went public, he was fired by the Bush Administration.

			<b>The Shark Finning Prohibition Act</b> was signed into law by Bill Clinton on December 21, 2000.
			It had forbidden finning by any vessels in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (up to 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) offshore), 
			and possession of fins by any U.S.-flagged fishing vessels on international waters. 
			It also prohibited any fishing vessel from landing at a U.S. port with shark fins whose weight exceeds 5% of the total weight of shark carcasses landed or on board. 
			These provisions left loopholes that would successfully be exploited in its first court test.

			<b>The Guanabara Bay oil spill</b>, one of three major spills in the bay, occurred in January 2000 in Brazil when a leaking pipeline released 1,300,000 litres (340,000 US gal) of oil 
			into Guanabara Bay. It leaked from the oil refinery at Duque de Caxias (REDUC) operated by Petrobras. Petrobas the company at the 
			center of the oil spill immediately moved into gear and hired a cleanup crew to assess the damages and start 
			the process to cleaning up the affected areas. This catastrophic accident had a damaging effect on marine life in the ocean, fishes, 
			as well as, other existing areas surrounding the bay area. Many fishes were washing up on the shore dead or covered in oil. The fishing industry took a nose dive and the fishermen's livelihood was gravely affected. As a matter of fact, the fishing industry was brought to a halt giving rise to economic downfall. There was astronomical cost to be incurred with the clean-up process and the stakeholders were in a state of growing panic. 
			Large areas of mangrove forests were killed and had not grown back ten years later.
