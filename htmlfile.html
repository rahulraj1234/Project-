		<h2>How to protect the environment?</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>The following protective and control measures are aimed at environmental protection.</h3><br>
		<dl class="last">
			<dt>Reforestation.</dt><br>
				<dd>Trees are very important. They play a great role in air purification, they are water catchment areas and a home to many other living species. 
				The more trees we have the purer the air and the less the chances of having water problems. Animals also have their own habitat in the forests.</dd><br>
			<dt>Use green technologies.</dt><br>
				<dd>Factories should try to go green. Use more environmentally friendly gases that are not harmful. Wind energy is one way to go about it. 
				Solar energy is also an applicable method. Use of renewable energy will reduce the harmful chemicals.</dd><br>
			<dt>Use less chemicals in factories.</dt><br>
				<dd>When the chemicals are less, this means that waste is also minimal. Not only the factories but also those who do farming. 
				Most of the pesticides and fertilizers used in farms end up in water bodies. It is important to use a reasonable amount that will not be harmful.</dd><br>
			<dt>Share your car or use public transport.</dt><br>
				<dd>Since cars are a major air pollutant, trying to minimize the number of cars on the road is important. People can choose to use more of public transport. 
				Families can share cars rather than each member of the family having a car or use bicycles where possible.</dd><br>
			<dt>Create awareness.</dt><br>
				<dd>It is important to educate people on the importance of environmental protection. The little things people do will do a long way in environmental protection.
				Encourage them on the importance of reusing and recycling. Encourage use of energy savers as well as collecting rain water. 
				It is also important to educate on animal conservation as well as taking part in tree planting programs. 
				There are so many organizations all over the world that are planting trees in the aim of saving the world.</dd><br>
			<dt>Be sustainable.</dt><br>
				<dd>Try as much as possible to reduce or eliminate waste and use the environment is an eco-friendly way. 
				Sustainability means reducing the use of natural resources so as to reduce the chances of depleting them.
				Use more of fluorescent tubes, use rechargeable batteries, use renewable energy, and use renewable bags for shopping are some of the ways to be sustainable.</dd><br>
			<dt>Plant trees along sea-beach.</dt><br>
				<dd>Sea beaches are low-lying lands that are bear. Planting trees in these areas will play a great role in protecting the environment. 
				They can serve as air purifiers and reduce the chances of harmful waste reaching the sea and oceans. They will also serve the purpose of preventing dunes.</dd><br>
			<dt>Conclusion.</dt><br>
				<dd>The environment is very important for the existence of life. It supports living things and protecting it should be our first priority.
				Without a conducive environment, we run the risk of extinction. It is good to understand that it is the environment that supports us and not vise versa.</dd><br>
