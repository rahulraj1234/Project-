			Â <b>The IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), Climate Change 2001</b>, is an assessment of available scientific and socio-economic information on climate change by the IPCC.
			Statements of the IPCC or information from the TAR were often used as a reference showing a scientific consensus on the subject of global warming. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) was completed in 2001 and consists of four reports, three of them from its Working Groups: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis;
			Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability;Working Group III: Mitigation;Synthesis Report.A number of the TAR's conclusions are given quantitative estimates of how probable it is that they are correct, e.g., greater than 66% probability of being correct.
			These are "Bayesian" probabilities, which are based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence.

			<b>Campbell Island, New Zealand is declared rat free, nearly 200 years after their introduction</b>
			In 2001, brown rats (Norway rats) were eradicated from the island nearly 200 years after their introduction. This was the world's largest rat eradication 
			programme. The island's rat-free status was confirmed in 2003.[16] Since the eradication, vegetation and invertebrates have been recovering, 
			seabirds have been returning and the Campbell teal, the world's rarest duck, has been reintroduced.
